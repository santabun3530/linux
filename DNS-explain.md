# DNS Resolution Process on Linux: From `amazon.com` to Server Connection

## ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Application Request (Browser, curl, ping)

When you type `amazon.com` in your browser or use a command-line tool like `ping` or `curl`, the application calls the **glibc resolver library** to resolve the hostname.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 2: nsswitch.conf â†’ Resolution Order

The glibc resolver checks `/etc/nsswitch.conf` for the `hosts:` line:

```
hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mymachines
```

This means hostname resolution occurs in this order:

1. `files` â†’ `/etc/hosts`
2. `mdns4_minimal` (mainly for .local addresses)
3. `dns` â†’ `/etc/resolv.conf`
4. `mymachines` â†’ local VM/container resolution

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 3: `/etc/hosts` File

The system first checks the `/etc/hosts` file:

```bash
cat /etc/hosts
```

ðŸ‘‰ If there's an entry for `amazon.com`, it uses that IP directly. **No DNS server is needed.**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 4: mDNS (Multicast DNS)

If the hostname ends with `.local` (e.g., `printer.local`), Avahi/Bonjour mDNS protocol is used.  
But `amazon.com` ends with `.com`, so mDNS is skipped.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 5: DNS Query via `/etc/resolv.conf`

The system reads `/etc/resolv.conf` to get the list of nameservers:

```bash
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

Example output:
```
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 1.1.1.1
```

ðŸ‘‰ The resolver library now sends a DNS query (UDP/TCP port 53) to the specified DNS server (e.g., Google or Cloudflare): *"Give me the A/AAAA record for amazon.com."*

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Nameserver â†’ Recursive Query Process

For example, if using 8.8.8.8, it performs:

1. Asks the Root DNS servers â†’ "Who manages `.com`?"
2. The `.com` TLD servers respond â†’ "Here are the authoritative servers for `amazon.com`"
3. Amazon's authoritative DNS servers reply â†’ "The IP for `amazon.com` is 205.251.242.103" (example)
4. The nameserver returns this IP to your machine

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 7: Caching

- The DNS response is cached in the **OS cache** (e.g., `systemd-resolved`) for a period based on TTL.
- Subsequent requests for `amazon.com` may not require querying external nameservers again.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 8: Browser â†’ IP Connection

Your browser now establishes a **TCP connection (port 443)** to the obtained IP (e.g., `205.251.242.103`) â†’ performs TLS handshake â†’ loads Amazon's website via HTTPS.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Summary: File/Directory Flow

1. **Application â†’ glibc resolver library**
2. **/etc/nsswitch.conf** â†’ determines resolution order
3. **/etc/hosts** â†’ local static mapping
4. **mDNS (Avahi)** â†’ for `.local` addresses
5. **/etc/resolv.conf** â†’ list of DNS servers
6. **DNS server (8.8.8.8, etc.)** â†’ recursive resolution
7. **systemd-resolved cache** (if enabled)
8. **Browser â†’ connects to Amazon's server**

---

## ðŸ”¹ DNS Client Resolver vs. DNS Server

### DNS Client Resolver
- This is your **Linux OS's internal library/service** (glibc resolver, systemd-resolved, nscd).
- Its job: When a program (browser, curl, ping) needs to resolve a hostname (`amazon.com`), the resolver:
  1. Checks `/etc/nsswitch.conf` for resolution order
  2. Checks `/etc/hosts` for local mappings
  3. Uses `/etc/resolv.conf` to query external DNS servers

ðŸ‘‰ Simply put: **The DNS client resolver is your system's "local agent" that fetches name-to-IP mappings from DNS servers.**

### DNS Server
- DNS server is separate server software (e.g., **BIND9, Unbound, dnsmasq, PowerDNS**).
- Its job: Maps hostnames to IPs and answers client resolver queries.
- Examples:
  - Your **ISP's DNS**
  - **Google DNS (8.8.8.8)**
  - **Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1)**
  - Or you can install `bind9` on your Linux server to create your own DNS server.

ðŸ‘‰ Simply put: **A DNS server is the "big database + service" that holds the actual name-to-IP mappings and serves clients.**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Comparison with Nginx

- **Nginx (Web Server)**
  - Client (browser) requests: *"Give me /index.html"*
  - Nginx serves content from its config or disk.

- **DNS Server**
  - Client resolver queries: *"Give me the IP for amazon.com"*
  - DNS server responds from its cache/authoritative zone.

- **DNS Client Resolver (on Linux)**
  - Browser says: *"Resolve amazon.com for me"*
  - Resolver checks local config (`/etc/hosts`, `/etc/resolv.conf`) â†’ queries DNS server â†’ returns answer to browser.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Why Run Your Own DNS Server (BIND9, etc.)?

While your machine's resolver can query external DNS servers, there are reasons to run your own DNS server:

### (a) Control for Your Network
- Example: You're a sysadmin at a company.
- You want `internal.company.local` names to resolve only within your office.
- Google DNS doesn't know these mappings â†’ you need a **local DNS server**.

### (b) Caching / Performance
- If many users query DNS simultaneously, querying external servers repeatedly is slow.
- Local BIND9 caches responses â†’ serves them faster.

### (c) Security / Filtering
- Use a local DNS server to blacklist domains (e.g., ads.example.com).
- Enforce DNSSEC.

### (d) Authoritative Role
- If you manage a public domain (e.g., `mycompany.com`), you need an **authoritative DNS server**.
- This tells everyone on the Internet: *"The real IP for mycompany.com is this."*
- This cannot be done via `/etc/resolv.conf`; it requires proper DNS server software (BIND9).

---

## ðŸ”¹ Flow with Local BIND9 Server

If you run a local BIND9 server, your `/etc/resolv.conf` might look like:

```
nameserver 127.0.0.1
```

With `/etc/nsswitch.conf`:
```
hosts: files dns
```

1. Browser/ping/curl â†’ asks glibc resolver: *"Resolve amazon.com"*
2. Resolver first checks `/etc/hosts` â†’ if not found
3. Then queries the nameserver (127.0.0.1 â†’ local BIND9)
4. BIND9 server responds recursively or authoritatively
5. Resolver returns the IP to the application (browser)
